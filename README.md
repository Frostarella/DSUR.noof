# DSUR.noof
DSUR.noof is a package for R, including (almost) all functions of the DSUR package mentioned in Andy Fields' "Discovering Statistics Using R". This is by no means an official version of the DSUR package -- just my private collection which I wanted to share.

# Installation
The package can be easily installed by using the devtools (install.package("devtools")).
Simply type the command install_github('DSUR.noof', 'Frostarella') into your R console.

# Credits
* Credits for the functions in the package go to Andy Field ("Discovering Statistics Using R") and G. Jay Kerns, Youngstown State University.
* This package was made by following Hilary Parkers' blog post on creating R packages ([read it here!] (https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/))
